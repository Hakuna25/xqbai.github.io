ABSTRACT = {Single UAVs have limited capabilities for complex missions, so suitable solutions are needed to improve the mission success rate, as well as the UAVs’ survivability. A cooperative multi-UAV formation offers great advantages in this regard; however, for large and complex systems, the traditional control methods will be invalid when faced with unstable and changing environments. To deal with the poor self-adaptability and high requirements for the environmental state information of traditional control methods for a multi-UAV cluster, this paper proposes a consistent round-up strategy based on PPO path optimization to track targets. In this strategy, the leader is trained using PPO for obstacle avoidance and target tracking, while the followers are expected to establish a communication network with the leader to obtain environmental information. In this way, the tracking control law can be designed, based on the consistency protocol and the Apollonian circle, to realize the round-up of the target and obstacle avoidance. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy can achieve the round-up of the target UAV and guide the pursuing multi-UAV group to avoid obstacles in the absence of the initial detection of the target. In multiple simulated scenarios, the success rates of the pursuit multi-UAV cluster for rounding up the target are maintained above 80%.},
