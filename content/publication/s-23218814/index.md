abstract: Single UAVs have limited capabilities for complex missions, so suitable
  solutions are needed to improve the mission success rate, as well as the UAVs’ survivability.
  A cooperative multi-UAV formation offers great advantages in this regard; however,
  for large and complex systems, the traditional control methods will be invalid when
  faced with unstable and changing environments. To deal with the poor self-adaptability
  and high requirements for the environmental state information of traditional control
  methods for a multi-UAV cluster, this paper proposes a consistent round-up strategy
  based on PPO path optimization to track targets. In this strategy, the leader is
  trained using PPO for obstacle avoidance and target tracking, while the followers
  are expected to establish a communication network with the leader to obtain environmental
  information. In this way, the tracking control law can be designed, based on the
  consistency protocol and the Apollonian circle, to realize the round-up of the target
  and obstacle avoidance. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy
  can achieve the round-up of the target UAV and guide the pursuing multi-UAV group
  to avoid obstacles in the absence of the initial detection of the target. In multiple
  simulated scenarios, the success rates of the pursuit multi-UAV cluster for rounding
  up the target are maintained above 80%.
